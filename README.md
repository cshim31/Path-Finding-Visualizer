# Path_Finding
Path finding software application for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Code implements A* pathfinding algorithm. Program is conducted using python.
## Features
* Simple navigation using A* path finding algorithm
* Supports wall to be drawn on the map for test variation

## Examples
* Path_Finding/Grid.py - Grid class that fills map with display function and each grid's coordinates variable.
* Path_Finding/Main.py - main file where compiling takes place.
